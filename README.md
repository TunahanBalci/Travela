## Setup Instructions

1. **Download The Repository**
2. **Configure appsettings.json:**
Replace YOUR_SERVER_NAME with your MSSQL Server name:

 ``` appsettings.json
 "DatabaseConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=mainDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;Integrated Security=True;" 
```

3. **Create Database Through Migrations**

In the package manager console, use these commands in order:

Crate the database
```Package Manager Console
update-database
```

If migrations create errors, delete all migrations inside the Migrations folder.
 
Then, add a new migration through package manager console.
```Package Manager Console
add-migration migration_name 
```
Finally, create the database:
```Package Manager Console
update-database
```

4. **Add An Admin**

Adding an admin is possible only through directly accessing the database.

Use SQL query to add an admin with the selected email.
For this, replace admin@app.com with admin's email in database.

``` SQL Query
UPDATE Users
SET isAdmin = 1
WHERE email = 'admin@app.com';
```
